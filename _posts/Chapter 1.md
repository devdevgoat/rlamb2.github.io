title: Defeat. Revelation. Conspiracy.
---

The night sky stretched in all directions, surrounding him completely, stars peppering his entire field of view, no matter which way he looked. Up? Down? Even when he tried to look at his hands, there were only more stars. He was floating or was he drifting? Regardless, a sinking feeling slowly over took him. 

But then there was a voice. A thin one. So fine he couldn't make out a single word. So quiet, it felt more like the memory of words. Words spoken ages ago. Their pronunciations and timbre lost in time, but somehow they still seemed meaningful in some way...

"You ok?" It was muffled, but the throbbing behind his ear made it crystal clear why they were asking.

"Uuunguh," Anok managed in reply as he rolled to one side, though what he had tried to say was much shorter, and much more inappropriate. 

"Listen, Son." The voice was softer now. Clearer. "I think it's time we had a serious talk about this. I can't in good conscience keep subjecting you to this. You're just too-" 

Anok lifted his hand, palm out, trying desperately to push back his fathers words. He pushed himself up with his other hand as quickly as possible, fighting gravity and the whirlpool it was forming in his inner ear. *A serious talk?* What had every dinner conversation for the past 4 years been if not serious? "Not now, Father."

Anok bent over to retrieve the oak sword, his armor resisting him ever step of the way both in weight and geometry. The two-sizes-to-large chest plate even blocked his sight depending on the angel, and now he tried desperately not to let it prevent him from bending over far enough to retrieve his weapon. He was breathing heavily. He lifted the wooden blade, and scanned the training area for his opponent.

"I sent Cassius home," his father said matter of factly. "His services were no longer needed."

"Father! It's not even noon, we've only just be-" 

"And yet we're already finished." His fathers voice was much more stern now. This was the voice of The Commander. With his hands clasped behind his back, he walked past Anok, who's shoulders drooped under the weight of the Commanders morning shadow as he passed both by, and over him. "Let go, Anok." He said solemnly.

His ears were still ringing. The last blow had left a mark, but it was the look in Cassius' eyes that hurt the most, and would likely last a lot longer. Anok had seen it all, as if moving in slow motion. Once Cassius was within range, Anok had brought his wooden sword down hard. After having been knocked out by his last blow, he wanted desperately to regain Cassius' respect. Cassius was a warrior. He only respected strength and agility. He was Fathers best soldier, and despite having never seen battle, he was a fierce opponent. Cassius deflected the blow with ease, then countered with even more grace. But Anok saw it. The disappointment in Cassius eyes, just before the back of his wooden sword made contact with Anoks skull. 

Anok followed his father quietly and from several steps behind as they made their way back to the house. His father walked tall, over a foot above him, even from several paces back. On the way to the training ground, he'd walked furiously to keep up with his fathers long strides, despite the bulky second hand armor. Of course, his father had urged him to find armor that fit more properly, but Anok insisted that he complete his training the same armor his father trained in, and if it was too heavy, the added weight would help him grow into it. *Ask not for lighter burdens,* he had quoted. 

The Commander stopped, and even though he didn't look up from his feet, Anok stopped as well. "Son, I think it's time we put this behind us. The gods did not deign you to be a warrior. And as much as the must hurt your pride, we must accept it."

Anok didn't reply. The Commander sunk his shoulders ever so slightly. The weight of his disappointment showing on him just for a moment, but he recovered quickly, and steeled himself. "If you continue down this path, you will surely be killed. Even if we never again go to war, the training alone will eventually catch up to you. Not everyone is as controlled as Cassius." 

Anok fought back the welling in his eyes. His father always spoke Cassius' name with such pride. *As he should,* he thought to himself.

"You did your best, son. Now let this be the end of it." And with that, his father continued up the dirt path and into the house. Anok heard the squeak of the hinges and the thunk of the heavy wooden door as it closed behind his father. He dropped to his knees, the steel skirt nearly cutting him in half as it dug into his abdomen. He slammed his fist into the dirt, while his the voice in side his head lashed at out him, targeting each insecurity he'd so masterfully hidden deep within. *You're weak! So pathetically weak!* his mind screamed. He could feel his internal defenses, the excuses and stories he'd told himself splintering with each blow. *You're nothing. You'll always be nothing.* The little barriers he had built up around those nagging thoughts that crept in when he least expected them.  The side comments and overheard remarks he'd hidden away behind childish optimism and naive hope. *The Gods did not deign you a warrior. You're too small!* 

The tears flowed freely now. His hand ached. Small pebbles imbedded themselves into his skin, his knuckles raw from the sand. He leaned forward catching his face in hands, and soon, the sand between his fingers became wet and caked.

*There has to be a way.* He thought to himself. *If the Gods can't help me, there must be another way.* And then the realization struck him. He caught his breath, then sat up slowly and readied himself for what he had to do next.

The candle light whipped and jerked with the furious pacing of the old man who, not long ago, thought himself much to old for such excitement. On the desk next to him, a quill wrote hastily, as though held by the hand of an invisible scribe, as it tried to catch up to its masters utterances. Then, abruptly, the man stopped. The tiny candle flame began to grow brighter as it caught breath on the cool damp air of the room.

"I see," Merlin said softly as he stroked his beard and studied the open book balanced perfectly in his hand. Two other books slowly lifted off the shelf on the far end of the room and floated over. He looked up at the first to arrive and with the wave of two fingers the pages flicked through with speed, and settled on one of the last few pages. The second book slowly hovered into place next to the first, to which he made same gesture unit the page he was looking for came into view.

He glanced between the six pages for a moment. Finally, the quill stopped and stood at the ready, perfectly balanced on its point. Merlin nodded slowly, a smile growing from beneath his white beard. 

The quill, and the parchment it had filled with several feet of elegant script, burst into a bright flame that lasted for only a second, but burned so hot it left no trace of ash behind it.

And a particular candle suddenly felt a little self-conscious.

"Are you certain, Sire-" Lord Theo took a pause as he tried to word his suggestion carefully. "Have you considered the possibility that your 'source' might simply be a remnant of the old war? Perhaps a long ago trap that failed to spring at it's original designation?"

"I understand your concern, General." Arthur sat, his hands clasped in concentration under his chin. "This most certainly sounds  like the sort of web Nagaroth would spin. And I too felt the urge to brush it aside. But we have had nearly two decades without conflict, and I fear, this is precisely the kind of thing that long periods of peace brings."

Theo took a breath, and thought through what The King had told him. "Well, I suppose the risk of not investigating far out ways the loss of trust." Theo crossed his harms, his gaze falling downward as he analyzed the safest path take in confirming Arthurs suspicions. Arthur nodded. 

"Take someone you trust, but don't tell them what you have heard hear. Let them make the report, and we'll compare notes between your source and mine."

Theo looked up, content to have the question answer for him. *How long had The King been mulling over this problem?* he wondered. "Your majesty." Theo bowed gracefully, then spun on his heal and left.

Arthur rose from his throne, and walked, contemplatively over to  the window that held at it's bottom the courtyard that budded with spring flowers. The thick glass sparkled a soft pink glow, and calmness eased in over his Arthurs shoulder.

"I fear I might loose a dear friend if everything you say is true, Navi." The radiant orb softly rested on Arthurs left shoulder, but as always, when she spoke, her voice filled his mind rather than whichever ear was closest.

"If I am not mistaken, I'm afraid we will all loose much more than that if I."
